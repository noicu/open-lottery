      <h2>New look for the Lott!</h2>
      <p>
        <b>You may have noticed we’ve changed our logo, but we’re still the official home of Australia’s lotteries.</b>
        <br />While our logo is changing, it’s important to note that there are no changes to our lottery games, pricing, membership or how you claim prizes. We’ll continue to inspire dreams, deliver wins, and bring you the games you love. Keep an eye out for our new logo rolling out across our 3,800 retailers Australia-wide. We love our new logo, and hope you do too!
